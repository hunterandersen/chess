## Differences between Classical, Blitz, and Bullet Chess

| "Slow Chess" | "Fast Chess" | "Speed Chess" | "WTF Chess" |
| What most people think of when they think of chess | What most people would actually enjoy playing | What I enjoy watching | Also what I enjoy watching |

## Noteworthy Chess Names
- Magnus Carlsen
    - The best chess player alive, and arguably the best to have ever played
- Gary Kasparov
    - Arguably the best to have ever played
- Yasser Seirawan
    - A great, old guy chess personality with lots of neat little stories from back in the day, but he doesn't have his own channel. So you might catch him on other channels, or doing live chess commentary for a channel like Chess.com
- Judit Polgar
    - The best female player to have ever played. Also still alive today and often does live commentary for Chess.com
- Bobby Fischer
    - Arguably the best to have ever played
- Mikhail Tal
    - Arguably the best to have ever played up to his time

### Every youtube channel will have the people (personalities) that will largely determine whether or not you enjoy their content, but there are a handful who focus so directly on chess that the personality is largely irrelevant
- Chessnetwork
    - NM Jerry (last name unknown) doesn't put his face in the corner of the videos, and he focuses on simply talking about the chess moves. Why are they good? Why do they work (or not work)? How can that translate to making you a better chess player? He's dryer than the rest of the channels, but you can find videos of him talking while playing blitz/bullet games and he is much more animated in those
- agadmator
    - Antonio RadiÄ‡ creates similar videos to Chessnetwork, but with less depth on his analysis and a faster approach to game recaps. To me, this results in less interesting videos since he's also not providing much entertainment beyond the game

### The next two are run by chess buisnesses and so they target a wide range of styles and events, often employ chess players, youtubers, and personalities, and you're mileage will vary greatly depending on which video/series you're watching on their channel
- Chess.com
    - Generally decent video ideas and enjoyable. They try to make content for both diehard chess fans/players and people who hardly understand chess so you can find content for either.
- Chess24
    - Same idea as chess.com, but just generally worse at all of it. To me it comes across a bit too formal/corporate while trying to be joking and "appealing to the youths"

### The next two I'm grouping together because they're both channels that feature two different people pretty equally, but also like to do collaborations where possible. They're mainly focused on creating fun/engaging chess content *while* they play chess, however they do have videos focused on helping new players learn, hosting fun events, and the occasional travel vlog
- Chessbrah
    - The name comes from the two brahs (GM Eric Hansen, and GM Aman Hambleton) from Canada and "brah" is sort of like "dude" up there. They're both witty and love playing bullet chess. And their streams/videos are known for featuring techno music while they play. I'm not a huge techno music fan, but people constantly leave comments saying they absolutley love the music choices
- BotezLive
    - This channel features two sisters (Alex and Andrea Botez). Their content often includes clips/videos where they lose their queen while playing, which has coined the phrase "Botez Gambit". And they also often yell at each other, often very loudly, in a way that only sisters truly can. Which can be very entertaining, or very grating. Up to you to decide.

### From here on out I can't group any together very well, other than saying that they are all a solo act, which means the individual's personality will be the most important determining factor on whether or not you like them

- Gotham Chess
    - No idea why he named it after the Batman city, but IM Levy Rozman is likely most well known for creating chess tournament recap videos in which he's highlighted certain games that demonstrate something amazing about the player(s), the beauty of the chess games themselves, or something incredible/topical about the event.
    - His style is very expressive, focusing on bringing to life the actions on the chessboard, even if you don't play chess. Sort of like a sports commentator describing the "crushing" or "brutal" plays of a footbal game.
    - He also makes instructional videos, and likes to interject little bits of his humor throughout the videos often making playful jabs at himself or his viewers
- Anna Cramling
    - Anna is extremely animated, constantly smiling and laughing (often at her own misplays in a game). It's a good-natured style, but honestly can be a bit too much for me, though it may be perfect depending on your taste.
    - She's not as talented at chess as many of the others listed, but she is the daughter of two chess Grand Masters (which is very rare) and does sometimes feature them on her channel. Those videos can be pretty entertaining
- IM Eric Rosen
    - I haven't watched much of Eric Rosen, but he's known for the phrase "oh no, my queen!", which he will say when he's laid out a trap for his opponent. If they fall into the trap of taking his queen, there is often a very punishing result.
    - His style is very laid-back and quiet compared to most.
- GingerGM
    - Again, I haven't seen much of his content, but he's been around for a very long time, so you can find nearly any style of content, whether it's instructional series, videos of him playing, or collaborations.

### The next three draw appeal mainly due to their incredible, stunning chess ability. These are some of the best players in the world at what they do, and it's a treat to watch them perform at such a level

- Daniel Naroditsky
    - GM Daniel (Danya) Naroditsky is one of the best bullet chess players alive today. He rivals the likes of GMs Magnus Carlsen, Hikaru Nakamura, Andrew Tang, Eric Hansen and more.
    - He's also phenominal at explaining chess step-by-step, demonstrating why tactics work and how you can help to train your brain to find those sorts of patterns in your games.
    - His combination of brilliant ability, approachable teaching, and genuinely great attitude is an awesome combination and makes him one of my favorites to watch.
- penguingm1 
    - GM Andrew Tang (the penguin) is also one of the best bullet chess players alive today. He is known for his incredible speed. Even speed demons like Hikaru and Danya often mention how truly fast Andrew is. It's really tough to fully describe what I'm talking about without seeing it.
- GM Hikaru 
    - GM Hikaru Nakamura has to be listed. He has a large youtube channel that's been quite successful, and since none of the other top level grand masters have done that, that leaves him, unarguably, as the best chess player with a successful youtube channel.
    - That being said, it was no mistake that I left him for last.
    - He seems to be, by many accounts, and with a long history, quite a dick. And for that reason, I'm out.
